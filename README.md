# Cryptography
### cryptography basics
Before we go into the details of cryptography, first we need to know the encoded values of every letter, small and capital, and all special characters in the keyboard in binary, hexadecimal, and alphabetic strings. Binary string takes only 0 and 1. Hexadecimal string takes values from 0 to 9 and a to f. For an alphabetic string, it encodes a small letter into its correspondence capital letter and capital letters remain the same. Alphabetic string doesn't work for any other symbols. This encryption of letters and symbols in cryptography is the basics things you need to know. These are the building blocks of all public key cryptosystems.
